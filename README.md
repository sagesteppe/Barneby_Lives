BarnebyLives! is an R program which serves to help botanical collectors in Western North America. BarnebyLives! runs multiple types of queries to acquire political and administrative, geographic, and taxononomic data for recently collected herbarium specimens. It also has limited abilities to search for taxonomic synonyms, check spelling of family, genus, and species names, as well as author abbreviations.  

BarnebyLives! serves the area of Western North America West of the 90th Western parallel, which roughly coincides the Mississippi River. The traditionally defined border to the Flora of Western North America. However, the area is bounded on it's North by Canada and South by Mexico, essentially it covers the Continental United States (which includes Alaska). Wihle it covers this range, most variables are focused on supporting botanists working West of the Colorado Front Range, especially those operating on Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service lands.

BarnebyLives! Is meant to supplement, not supplant, collectors field note endeavors. Variables which BarnebyLives! may produce for each collection includes:

**Political**  
- State  
- County   
- Township  
- Public Land Survey System (township, range, section)  

**Geographic**
- Mountain Range (if relevant)  
- Nearest GNIS place name, and azimuth from it  

**Site characteristics**  
- Elevation (both meters and feet)  
- Slope  
- Aspect  
- Surficial geology  
- Geomorphon  

**Taxonomic**  
- Searches for synonym to species  
- Quick spell check for Family, Genus, and specific epithet 
- Consults taxonomic authors abbreviations to ensure correct spelling 

**Directions**  
- directions to a parking spot can be acquired from Google Maps; however this implies the location is drivable in the first place. This will require interactive alterations from the user. 

**Other features include**   
- Date parsing, e.g. convert date into congruent museum formats (month in roman numerals)  
- Conversion of Degrees Minutes Seconds (DMS) to Decimal Degrees (DD; )  
- Exporting collection data as a 'shapefile' or KML for use in a GIS or GoogleEarth

If the datasheet which is submitted to BarnebyLives! contains text in a cell, the program WILL NOT BE QUERIED for that variable if it is under 'Site Characteristics'. 

Currently BarnebyLives! Is being run on a juiced up computer either in Rogers Park Chicago or Reno. The amount of data which it queries is very large. Please let me know if you have a query and I will run it for you. If you only collect from a smaller portion of the West, e.g. a certain state, or FS/BLM Unit/Field Office, you should be able to set up a local instance. Although, the document for such an endeavor is nascent. 

*BarnebyLives! Was named after Rupert Charles Barneby, botanist extraordinaire, artist, socialite, and kind hearted human being. He is the hero the West needs not racist, misogynists, such as Hayduke. Hence, BarnebyLives!*
