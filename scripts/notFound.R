#' notify user if an entry had any results not found in POWO
#' 
#' @description simple function to run on 'powo_searcher' results to show species not found which 
#' @param x output of 'powo_searcher' after binding rows
#' @param returns messages to consoles indicating search terms, and there status if failed to be found. This desirable because 'powo_searcher' squashes these errors. 
#' @example 
#' names_vec <- taxize::names_list(rank = 'species', size = 10) # 10 random species from taxize, usually 1 or 2 species are not found in Plants of the world online
#' pow_results <- lapply(names_vec, powo_searcher) |> 
#'   dplyr::bind_rows() 
#' pow_results[,1:5] # if there is not a family which is 'NOT FOUND', reshuffle the random species from taxize. 
#' notFound(pow_results) # little message. 
#' @export
